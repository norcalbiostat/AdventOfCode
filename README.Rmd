[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) is a series of increasingly difficult programming challenges, released daily each year throughout December in the run-up to Christmas.

This website is created from the  [EllaKaye/advent-of-code-website-template](https://github.com/EllaKaye/advent-of-code-website-template) template repository. There's documentation on how to use and adapt the template in that repo's README.

It is built with [Quarto](https://quarto.org) and works hand-in-hand with the R package [**aochelpers**](https://github.com/EllaKaye/aochelpers). See the [package website](https://ellakaye.github.io/aochelpers/) for more details.
