[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) is a series of increasingly difficult programming challenges, released daily each year throughout December in the run-up to Christmas.

This website is created from the  [EllaKaye/advent-of-code-website-template](https://github.com/EllaKaye/advent-of-code-website-template) template repository. There's documentation on how to use and adapt the template in their repo README.

This is less of a "just post the solution" and more of me "talking through" solving the problem. Often including some troubleshooting and/or dead ends. I blame the teacher in me that likes to show problem solving processes.
