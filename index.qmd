[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) is a series of increasingly difficult programming challenges, 
released daily each year throughout December in the run-up to Christmas.

This website is created from the  [EllaKaye/advent-of-code-website-template](https://github.com/EllaKaye/advent-of-code-website-template) template repository. 
There's documentation on how to use and adapt the template in the repo README.

It is built with [Quarto](https://quarto.org) and works hand-in-hand with the R package [**aochelpers**](https://github.com/EllaKaye/aochelpers). 
The package provides function to manage this website, e.g. to create new posts from a template, 
to download and read in the puzzle input, 
and will eventually include functions to help with the challenges themselves. See the [package website](https://ellakaye.github.io/aochelpers/) for more details.

Let's do this!
